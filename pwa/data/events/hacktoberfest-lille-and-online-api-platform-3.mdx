# Hacktoberfest @Lille & online [API Platform 3]

Les-Tilleuls.coop is organizing a hackathon on Thursday, October 7th from 7pm in Lille (we will also be available remotely) with maintainers of Open Source projects.

This evening will be focused on API Platform 2.7 and its few tickets to be closed and we will prepare the imminent V3.

KÃ©vin Dunglas (API Platform creator and Symfony core team) and Vincent Chalamon (API Platform core team) will host this event and they will be accompanied by several API Platform core team members and maintainers such as Alan Poulain and GrÃ©goire HÃ©bert.
