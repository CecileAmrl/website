# API Platform meetup live @Youtube (English-speaking talks)

Save the date! We are thrilled to announce a new API Platform online meetup! Join us on March 18th 2021 at 19:00 (CET) on our Youtube channel and listen to two ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ English-speaking talks!

We are very lucky to listen to KÃ©vin Dunglas, who will give an update about API Platformâ€™s new features. We will discover the new best practices and the unknown gems provided by the framework. Follow him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dunglas)

We're also extremely pleased to have Matthew Holt giving us a presentation of Caddy Server, a fast & powerful web server written in Go supporting HTTPS natively. We will see during his talk a detailed presentation of this fully-featured server he created in 2015. Follow him on Twitter: https://twitter.com/mholt6

Talks will be pre-recorded but speakers will be live on the Youtube chat.
