# Domain Driven Design with API Platform 3

At Les-Tilleuls.coop, we like to use API Platform. Mainly because it addresses a lot of questions about web API design, but also for its ease of use. This simplicity, however, comes with a cost that is generally felt when you need to get out of the box.

Fact is that at Les-Tilleuls.coop we also enjoy working on applications with strong business constraints, and even more to get off the rails. And when appropriate, we do so based on the DDD principles.

Hexagonal message-oriented architecture, business logic decoupled from the infrastructure, â€¦ So many precepts that become prerequisites when it comes to putting the business at the center of our applications while ensuring their good maintainability.
