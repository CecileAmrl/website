# Hackathon @Lille & online [API Platform 3]

Les-Tilleuls.coop is organizing a hackathon on Tuesday, November 9th from 7pm in Lille and online with maintainers of Open Source projects.

This evening will be focused on API Platform 3: we're getting closer to the release of the next API Platform version! Let's continue the work we started last time!

Kévin Dunglas (API Platform creator and Symfony core team) and Antoine Bluchet (API Platform core team) will host this event and they will be helped by several API Platform core team members and maintainers.

ℹ️ This event is held in Lille but our maintainers speak English so you're more than welcome.
